5. `Arbitrary values` - Custom sizing with square brackets (e.g., "use arbitrary values [w-42rem] for the hero section")
6. `Dark mode` - Theme toggle functionality (e.g., "implement dark mode toggle with appropriate colour shifts")
7. `JIT compiler` - Just-in-time compilation (e.g., "leverage JIT compiler features for the animation effects")
8. `Group-hover` - Parent-child interaction states (e.g., "apply group-hover effects to the card's action buttons")
9. `Ring utilities` - Focus state styling (e.g., "add ring utilities for interactive elements")
10. `Space-between` - Flexbox spacing (e.g., "use space-between for the navigation items")

## Shadcn Words

---

For interfaces using shadcn components, these 10 terms communicate component implementation expertise:

1. `Compound components` - Related elements that work together (e.g., "use compound components for the date picker")
2. `Polymorphic components` - Adaptable base elements (e.g., "make the button a polymorphic component")
3. `Collapsible sections` - Toggle visibility areas (e.g., "implement collapsible sections for the FAQ items")
4. `Command palette` - Keyboard-navigable menu (e.g., "add a command palette for quick actions")
